## **Introduction**
Have you ever felt like you need some interesting, daily-life examples to apply your knowledge while learning R?

Have you ever felt like some explanations in textbooks are very abstract?

At least that was my thought when I first started to practice coding in R in the last few months.

I come from a half-humanities background, and only began coding with Python three years ago. So it cost me a while to adjust my style of learning from walking through **zigzagging paths of literature plots**, not knowing what could happen in the process of reading, to running straight towards **a specified, expected destination of code blocks**. Unlike literature, there is not an "another" explanation to certain lines of codes.

Back then, my mind were still somewhat default set to the way it works when reading literary works. I found myself struggling a lot understanding the new thought-process of solving problems, new programming language and syntax. To be honest, for most of the time, real-world examples and stories in the textbooks made more sense to me.

This is when I realized maybe a series of tutorials on R from my point of view might be helpful for people who are also from humanities background. I will be incorporating many daily-life (and maybe also pop culture) examples into our process of learning to program in R. **I will continue trying to frame the explanation of coding into easy story-telling.**

This post will serve as {{< hl >}}a regularly-updated collection and signpost of the set of tutorials{{< /hl >}} I create. Whenever you feel lost, just simply refer to this post to locate the the specific content/theme you are looking for.

I can't wait to share with you my experience of coding!

Hopefully this sounds exciting üéâ and happy learning ‚úçÔ∏è
