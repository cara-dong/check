title: "Welcome to xxx Boba Place ðŸ¥¤1st Day Training"

## **Let's get R prepared to make boba...**
Hello everyone! 

Today, I will be training our employee "R" who works at our newly-opened fruit boba place (this guy is somewhat mysterious, so let's just bear with him not revealing his name:)

As we know, boba place could be really busy during the day, and the amount of fruits needed is also stunningly large. So, it is important for employees to prepare them before we open to our customers. Thankfully, we have R to help us complete such work quick and neat. Let's get started:

1. Check if the fruits that need to be peeled are ready
2. Peel them (real quick)
3. Blend all fruits well to be used in later milk-tea making

So, let's help R jot down these instructions in its notebook for reference when it started preparing fruits.

```python
print("Check fruits are in store.")
print("Check fruits are in store.")
```
