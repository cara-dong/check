I am an undergraduate student double-majoring in Data Science and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley. I am passionate about dealing with large datasets, writing journals and learning new languages (not just programming). My mother language is Mandarin Chinese, and I am fluent in English and Spanish.

I have tutored undergraduate-level, introductory data science course at Berkeley. I have also remotely-tutored art history and world history courses for high school students for four semesters. I learn and grow by teaching, so I really enjoy the process!
